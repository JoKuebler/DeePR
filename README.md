# DeePR

A convolutional neural network (CNN) for the prediction of Tetratricopeptide reapeats (TPR) in amino acid sequences.


# Built With

* [Keras](https://keras.io/)

# Network architecture

The architecture of DeePR consists of multiple convolutional layers with different properties (filters etc.), dropout layers, pooling layers and one final fully connected layer.

# Data

The network was trained on multiple hundred thousand sequences both TPR sequences and non-TPR sequences.
